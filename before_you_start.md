# Before You Start

If you haven't already, you'll need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Installation instructions for Windows can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/). If prompted to choose between using Linux or Windows containers during setup, make sure you choose Linux containers.

You can check if you have docker installed by running the following command in your shell:

```bash
$ docker --version
```

You should get a response similar to the following:
```bash
Docker version 19.03.8, build afacb8b
```

You will also need to create an account on Docker Hub. You can do so [here](https://hub.docker.com/signup).
